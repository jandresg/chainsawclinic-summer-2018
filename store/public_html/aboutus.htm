        <p>Since 1957 Chain Saw Clinic Ltd. has been serving the outdoor power 
          equipment needs for the southern Ontario area. First and mainly with 
          chain saws as many products that we see and use today were not even 
          invented yet. But as needs for other products increased, our product 
          offering also increased, so did our focus. Today we carry a complete 
          line of power equipment for your needs.</p>
          <bk>The ideas of opening a chain saw shop started with Geoffrey Robinson 
          who wanted to add a little extra income to the family with a part time 
          business along with his regular job. However, in those days &#8220;moonlighting&#8221; 
          was cause for dismissal so the company was put in his son&#8217;s name 
          Ron Sr. and also not sure if the business would succeed or not so as 
          to not risk his regular employment.
		  <p>          Back then, chain saws were considered a luxury item and you were well-off 
          if you had one for non-professional use. In time a rental store was 
          added into the mix till the early seventies when the focus changed back 
          to chain saws with the ongoing popularity with chain saws and the desire 
          to cut firewood for home use. As the popularity of other power equipment 
          increased such as string trimmers and snow blowers, Chain Saw Clinic 
          also increased its product offerings.<br>
          Today we strive to provide great product brands with great service support 
          as the 3rd generation (Ron Jr) takes over the daily activities here 
          at the &#8220;Clinic&#8221;. As it is family owned and operated, we 
          invite you to stop by and see us and hopefully fulfill your power equipment 
          needs. </p>
